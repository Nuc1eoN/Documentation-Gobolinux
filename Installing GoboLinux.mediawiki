```Installer``` is a program included on the GoboLinux
Live-ISO that installs GoboLinux to your hard drive.
It takes care of basic configuration, package selection, and
boot loader setup.  It can be run from the command line or via the
window manager menu. 

Before you install, you will need to prepare an appropriate disk
partition and swap partition. See the Manual Install
section below for details.

== Graphical Install  ==

The GoboLinux Live-ISO supports a complete graphical
display environment.

In most cases, the X server automatically detects the
keyboard and display hardware, so you can start the
graphical mode by typing:

     startx 

Clicking on the top-left icon brings up a menu. Look under
System Tools, select "Install GoboLinux", 
follow the instructions.

As a failsafe, we also provide an interactive text-based frontend for the installer. You can launch it by typing

== Console install ==

Type ```Installer``` in the console. Note the capital "i".
GoboLinux utility scripts are generally named with an
initial capital and follow the CamelCase convention.

== Manual install ==

If for some reason the installer does not work for you neither in X or in
the console, don't despair. You can still install GoboLinux the manual way,
as it was done in previous versions.

'''Step 1: The partition'''

Initially, you will need at least two partitions, one for the system
and one for swap (you can reuse the swap partition of another Linux
distribution).

You can create a partition by clicking on "GParted" in the
System Tools menu on the desktop or by using the "cfdisk"
utility on the console.

Afterwards you need to format the system partition.

    mkfs -t ext4 /dev/<system partition>

If you created a swap partition, use mkswap:

    mkswap /dev/<swap partition>


'''Step 2: Mount your new partition and enable swap'''

Mount your new partition, using a command such as

    mount /dev/<system partition> /Mount/GoboLinux 

Enable your swap partition, using command line as

    swapon /dev/<swap partition> 


'''Step 3: Install the system'''

Now, run the script to copy the system from this CD to the new
partition (which is mounted at /Mount/GoboLinux). There are some predefined
'profiles' located at /System/Links/Shared/Installer/Profiles/. A profile is just a set of programs
that will be installed if you choose it. Currently, they are:

- 'Base': contains only the basic packages for a usable system (350 MB)
- 'Typical': A more complete basic system
- 'Full': contains all programs from this Live-ISO (1.0 GB)

Go to the profiles directory and run [[ProfileInstall]], passing the
chosen profile and the mount point used on Step 2. For example:

    cd /System/Links/Shared/Installer/Profiles
    ProfileInstall Full /Mount/GoboLinux 


'''Step 4: Perform some basic configuration'''

Before you can be able to boot your new GoboLinux system, you'll have to
change a few of the default settings to reflect your system. The file

    /Mount/GoboLinux/System/Settings/fstab 

contains the partition list. Configure it as usual. Another file which
you will have to edit is

    /Mount/GoboLinux/Programs/BootScripts/Settings/BootScripts/Options 

This file contains configurations for programs that are called at boot
time, such as the system's hostname, mouse configuration and keymap
layout.

The Live-ISO has four text editors: MCEdit, which you can
access using the convenient wrapper 'e', Nano (a clone of
Pico), Vim, a popular programmer's editor and ed, an
old-school line editor.

'''Step 5: Bootloader'''

Before you reboot the system you will need to install a bootloader and
configure it, if you don't have one installed yet. We suggest GRUB.
To install it just run

    grub 
    grub> root (hd*,**) 
    grub> setup --prefix=/System/Kernel/Boot/grub (hd*) 
    grub> quit 


* *  The index of your GoboLinux disk: The first hard disk * is 0, the second is 1, and so on. 
* ** The index of your GoboLinux partition: The first  partition is 0, the second is 1, etc. 
* You can use the <tab> key to can see the choices that you have.

Now you can configure Grub. Go to
/Mount/GoboLinux/System/Kernel/Boot/grub and edit the
menu.lst file. In this file you will find some examples.
Most likely, all you'll need to do is put the same disk and
partition indices used to install GRUB in the first example.

'''Step 6: Reboot!'''

Once you have installed the bootloader, reboot the machine,
and remove the cd before the system starts. The machine 
will boot from the hard disk.  Welcome to your new system!

Now that your system is running, you can fine-tune it to suit
your needs. Check out the /System/Settings/BootScripts directory for
settings such  as network configuration, and usual Linux settings such
as /System/Settings/hosts and /System/Settings/resolv.conf.
See [[Bootscripts]] for details.

The only login is "root", the superuser, with default password, "gobo".
We recommend that you create a regular user account for normal use,
and use the powers of "root" only for system administration tasks.
For example, to create a new user called "john", type "[[AddUser]] john".
