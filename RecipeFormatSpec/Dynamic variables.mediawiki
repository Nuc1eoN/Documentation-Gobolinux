== Dynamic variables ==

Compile automatically creates variables that can be used in the functions.

=== System variables ===
To help you in recipe writing, Compile gives you the following run-time variables to use, each referring to a specific filesystem hierarchy's member.
{{Question | I don't think they're all here, which others exist?}}
*$goboExecutables
*$goboHeaders
*$goboModules
*$goboLibraries
*$goboPrograms
*$goboSettings
*$goboTemp
*$goboVariable

Which respectively point to (by default):

*/System/Index/bin
*/System/Index/include
*/System/Kernel/Modules
*/System/Index/lib
*/Programs
*/System/Settings
*/System/Variable/tmp
*/System/Variable

Thus, if you're writing a recipe for some program which accepts configure options and for which you need to manually specify a library path, you can use the $goboLibraries variable like

 configure_options=(
    "--with-extra-libraries=$goboLibraries/<path_to_the_library>"
 )

The same applies to the remaining as well, depending on specific program's needs.

=== Program variables ===
For every recipe there will always be variables for the program prefix as well as variables for the settings directory and the variable directory for the program.

*$target
*$settings_target
*$variable_target

For the recipe for '''Foobar 2.1''' those variables will have the values of ''$goboPrograms/<nowiki>FooBar</nowiki>/2.1'', ''$goboPrograms/<nowiki>FooBar</nowiki>/Settings'' and ''$goboPrograms/<nowiki>FooBar</nowiki>/<b></b>Variable'' respectively.

=== Dependency variables ===
There will also be variables for every dependency listed in the Dependency file. If for example '''Foo 1.2''' is listed as dependency, the variables will be called

*$foo_path
*$foo_settings_path
*$foo_variable_path

''Note that these variables will point to the latest installed version of '''Foo''', instead of the version listed in the Dependency file.''<!-- it seems better to me to emphasize this fact -->
''Also note that special characters will be replaced with underscore. If, for example, GTK+ is listed in the Dependency file, the variable will be called $gtk__path, and Tcl-Tk will be $tcl_tk_path.''
