I would like to see boot script themes that actually work.  :-)  I tried AppleII and a few others, and they rendered the system unusuable.  Filesystems were left read-only.  Paths couldn't be found.  In no case could CTRL-ALT-DEL be used to reboot the machine.  Just a mess!

The only working one was Progress.  :)  Thank you.
