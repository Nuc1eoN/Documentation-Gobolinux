If I wanted to run make my self, what would I need to do to sandbox it? It would be useful to know how its done.

<blockquote>
tar xvzf Foo.tar.gz <br/>
cd Foo  <br/>
PrepareProgram Foo 1.0 -- --enable-crazy-feature-x <br/>
make <br/>
PrepareProgram -t Foo 1.0 <br/>
SandboxInstall Foo 1.0 <br/>
SymlinkProgram Foo 1.0 <br/>
