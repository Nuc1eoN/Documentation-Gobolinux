Normally, you shouldn't need to compile "manually", i.e., without using
the [Compile](/Commands/Compile) tool. However, it is possible to
manually run the same commands that `Compile` uses.

## Overview

Compiling programs in Linux is typically a three-part process: prepare
the sources with `./configure`, compile them with `make`, and install
the compiled program with `make install`.

To this process, Gobo adds a source configuration step to target the
GoboLinux directory structure, and after the install phase, a step that
symlinks the files from the application directory under `/Programs` to
`/System/Index`. It is this last step that makes programs "visible" to
the GoboLinux system.

These are the relevant commands:

-   [PrepareProgram](/Commands/PrepareProgram)
-   [SandboxInstall](/Commands/SandboxInstall)
-   [SymlinkProgram](/Commands/SymlinkProgram)

[PrepareProgram](/Commands/PrepareProgram) is a wrapper to the first
step described above. [SandboxInstall](/Commands/SandboxInstall) is a
wrapper to the third step, ensuring safe execution of `make install`.
[SymlinkProgram](/Commands/SymlinkProgram) performs the final
operations that integrate the new program into the system.

## Setting up the sources: PrepareProgram

The [PrepareProgram](/Commands/PrepareProgram) script does two things.
It creates a directory hierarchy for the program under `/Programs`, and
it attempts to prepare the sources for compilation.

The syntax for the [PrepareProgram](/Commands/PrepareProgram) is:.

```
PrepareProgram <program-name> <version-number> [ -- <additional-options> ]
```

Passing a program name and version number is mandatory. These names are
the ones used in the directories under programs. For example,

```
PrepareProgram --tree Foo 1.0
```

(the `--tree` switch) creates the directories `/Programs/Foo/Settings`,
`/Programs/Foo/1.0`, `/Programs/Foo/1.0/bin` and so on.

The second task performed by [PrepareProgram](/Commands/PrepareProgram)
is to prepare the sources. Since there isn't a standardized format for
distribution of source-code tarballs in the free software world, there
is no way to implement completely automated preparation. Fortunately,
the popularization of the GNU AutoTools brings us much closer.

[PrepareProgram](/Commands/PrepareProgram), in this second step, will
detect availability of preparation tools and perform one of the
following:

1.  If the program includes a `configure` script generated by GNU
    autoconf, [PrepareProgram](/Commands/PrepareProgram) will run it,
    passing the necessary options (mainly `--prefix`, `--sysconfdir`) as
    well as any additional options requested by the user in the command
    line (as `<additional-options>`).
2.  Some authors develop their own `configure` scripts, but due to the
    popularity of GNU autoconf, design a command line interface similar
    to that used by autoconf.
    [PrepareProgram](/Commands/PrepareProgram) tries to detect if a
    non-autoconf `configure` script accepts at least the `--prefix`
    option, and uses it.

In short, [PrepareProgram](/Commands/PrepareProgram) can be considered
a wrapper to `configure`. Instead of running, for example,

```
cd foo-1.0
./configure --with-shared=yes
```

you'll run

```
cd foo-1.0
PrepareProgram Foo 1.0 -- --with-shared=yes
```

## SandboxInstall

Strictly speaking, if everything were configured correctly you could
simply run `make` and `make install`, and all files would be installed
under the appropriate subdirectory under `Programs/`.

To ensure this happens is to guarantee the modularity of the software
installation.

To prevent any possibility of files being copied elsewhere in the
directory tree than the target under `/Programs`, GoboLinux conducts the
install step in a "sandbox" that is isolated from the rest of the
filesystem.

[SandboxInstall](/Commands/SandboxInstall) constructs a container for
`make install`. It uses a sandbox provided by the
[FiboSandbox](/Commands/FiboSandbox) script, which configures custom
permissions for an allowed set of paths to a special user,
[fibo](/Documentation/Fibo/). On systems with a UnionFS backend (such as
FunionFS, UnionFS-FUSE or OverlayFS), the sandbox is provided by the
alternative script [UnionSandbox](/Commands/UnionSandbox). Installation
then runs confined to a sandbox, with no permission to write anywhere
but the few places [SandboxInstall](/Commands/SandboxInstall) allows it
to, such as `/Programs/Foo/Current` and `/Programs/Foo/Settings`.
Therefore, no files can be installed in "random places". A typical call
to [SandboxInstall](/Commands/SandboxInstall) looks like this:

```
SandboxInstall Foo 1.0
```

If necessary, additional options can be passed. Refer to the [
SandboxInstall reference page](/Commands/SandboxInstall) for details.

## Linking the sources: SymlinkProgram

The final step in the compilation of a program is performed by the
[SymlinkProgram](/Commands/SymlinkProgram). This is the script
responsible for creating the symbolic links under `/System/Index`.

The syntax for [SymlinkProgram](/Commands/SymlinkProgram) is:

```
SymlinkProgram program-name [ version-number ]
```

The second argument is optional. If no version number is specified, the
one linked as `Current` will be used. A commonly used command-line
parameter is `-c` `overwrite`, which tells it to overwrite any existing
symlinks in case of conflicts (the default action is to preserve the
existing links in order to not affect previously existing applications).
To integrate a program `Foo` into the `/System` structure, overwriting
any links, you would type:

```
SymlinkProgram -c overwrite Foo
```

[SymlinkProgram](/Commands/SymlinkProgram) features many command-line
switches, to cover more advanced needs. You can refer to the [
SymlinkProgram reference page](/Commands/SymlinkProgram) for details if
necessary.
