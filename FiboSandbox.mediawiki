Run the program in a protected sandbox, as a restricted user.

Usage: '''FiboSandbox''' [<options>] <program> [<command-parameters...>]

Options:
* '''-h, --help''' - Shows this help.
* '''-v, --version''' - Show program version.
* '''-V, --verbose''' - Enable verbose mode.
* '''-o, --original''' - Restore original owners.
* '''-r, --restore''' ''<entry>'' - Restore ownership to <entry>.
* '''-d, --directory''' ''<entry>'' - The program should be run at <entry>. This path should be either absolute, or relative to the sandbox root.
* '''-s, --sandbox''' ''<entry>[:<entry>...]'' - Colon-separated list of areas where the restricted user has write access to. The default value is '.'.


To allow mobility within the sandbox, the '.' directory is mounted at
a sandbox root (like /System/Variable/tmp/.[[FiboSandbox7824]]). For this reason, use of relative paths like '..' to reach
directories higher in the hierarchy than '.' may produce unexpected results.
It may also confuse symbolic links that flow through the sandbox.


Examples:
<blockquote>
FiboSandbox -r 0.0 -s '.:/Programs/NaughtyApp/Current' make install <br/>
</blockquote>


Note about the name: Fibo is a user without privileges to touch anything outside the sandbox. (This is related to unmanaged files)
