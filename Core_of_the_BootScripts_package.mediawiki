The main file in the core is /Programs/[[BootScripts]]/''<version>''/bin/[[BootDriver]]. It is the script called by <code>init</code> (from the Sysvinit package), as indicated in the file <code>/System/Settings/inittab</code>.

One of the first things done by the [[BootDriver]] is to load the boot theme file indicated in /System/Settings/BootOptions (see [[Configuring the Boot Process#Configuring boot themes|Configuring boot themes]]). This ensures that the boot procedure will behave accordingly to the user's desire.

Then, depending on what is going on (system startup, shutdown...), the [[BootDriver]] script runs one of the files in /System/Settings/[[BootScripts]], as described in section [[Configuring the Boot Process#Customizing the initialization|Customizing the initialization]].
