Use the [[UpdateRecipes]] command to refresh your local cache of the [[GoboLinux]] recipe store.

[[Freshen]] is a console application that checks for updated [[GoboLinux]] recipes and packages, with an output similar to "emerge" in Gentoo.

You can query available updates using the utilities [[SuggestUpdates]], [[SuggestDuplicates]] and [[PrioritiseUpdates]]. Outputs are suitable for piping into commands.

For the curious (or tweakers), it's interesting to note that most of the programs mentioned above make use of some general helper scripts such as [[FindPackage]] and [[GetAvailable]].

[[The Manager tool | Manager]] (not supported for Gobo 016) is a graphical application that not only informs you of new versions of programs, but also provides a GUI for most of the system management scripts, including [[Compile]]. It is based on the Qt toolkit.
