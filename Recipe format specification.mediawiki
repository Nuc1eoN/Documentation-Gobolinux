This page is meant to be a contributor's reference while writing [[Recipe]]s.

This page applies both to Recipes and patches in the main recipe directory and those in any architecture subdirectories.
An architecture-specific Recipe file is sourced in addition to the base Recipe file.  Variable assignments will override earlier ones, so to append to a variable, you must do so explicitly, e.g.
 configure_options=(
    ${configure_options[@]}
    --with-cpu=i686
    --enable-add-ons
 )
