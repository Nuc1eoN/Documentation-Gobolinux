Generate and sign a hash file of a Gobolinux package with gpg.

Usage: '''SignProgram''' { [<options>] <package> [<version>] }

Options:
* '''-h, --help''' - Shows this help.
* '''-v, --version''' - Show program version.
* '''-V, --verbose''' - Enable verbose mode.
* '''-u, --local-user''' <entry> - Use <entry> as the user ID to sign with.
* '''-S, --no-signature''' - Just create FileHash.  No GPG signing.

If no version is specified, Current is assumed.  If the -u option isn't
used, the first ID found in the secret keyring is used.
