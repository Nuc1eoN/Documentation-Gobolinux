==Basic conflict resolution guidelines==
*For the vast majority of programs, we can just take the project name as found in the program's tarball (ie, "name" in "name-1.0.tar.gz") and apply the [[Package Naming Guidelines]]).
*When a project has a long and a short name (as in multi-word vs. acronym), we'll use the shorter name.
*When still in doubt, let's look at the way other distributions name them, and follow the most common name.

==Conflict list==
===F===
*'''Firefox''' - short name - not FireFox, not MozillaFirefox, not Mozilla_Firefox.

===J===
*'''JACK''' - prefer acronym.  Not ''Jackit'' or ''Jack-Audio-Connection-Kit''

===K===
*'''KDE-Libs''', '''KDE-Base''', '''KDE-Graphics''' and so on - not KDE.  This way, it is easier to let each user decide which parts of KDE he or she needs. When compiling KDE, the correct order is: KDE-Libs, KDE-Base, <Other KDE-*>, KDE-Addons.

===L===
*'''LibArt_LGPL''' - match other distros - not LibArt
*'''LibStdC++''' - stand-alone version of GCC's Standard C++ Library - use the corresponding ''GCC version'' as the version number.  This is a custom package we build based on our GCC packages, so it makes more sense to keep this kind of version tracking instead of using the (not always reliable?) .so version.

===M===
*Mozilla Firefox - see ''Firefox''
