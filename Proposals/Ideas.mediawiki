==  Filesystem Hierarchy Standard ==
Filesystem hierarchy should be documented as a standard,this helps software vendors (who distribute their software only in binary form) to comply gobo's filesystem.

==  zsh ideas ==

Tab-completion which inserts quotes instead of backslashes.

== Categorized programs ==

The directory /Programs could be categorized too: /Programs/Net, /Programs/Graphics, etc

[editor: tags are the thing now.]

== RemoveProgram (new feature) ==

should test .GoboTimestamp (or program's directory) ctime against contents before removing, then print files changed after installation + ask Remove all/Nothing/Remove not changed.<br>

This is cool. Try doing it with the program's directory, if not possible use Resources/Timestamp (no need to use dot files, we have the Resources directory for this kind of thing). Show us the code and we'll add it. :) -- [[User:Hisham|hisham]]

== Compile (small change) ==

If you have sources already extracted, want to use them, but don't have downloaded archive, Compile wants to download it first, even if it's not necessary (it should ask if old sources may be used first). <br>
Author: jan molic<br>
Compile tries to run wget -c on the file because it doesn't know if the download is complete. If the recipe contains file''md5 and file''size entries, Compile uses them to test if the file is complete before trying to run wget again. -- [[User:Hisham|hisham]]
