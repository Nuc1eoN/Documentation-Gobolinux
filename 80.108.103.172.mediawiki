Thats me :) I can be usually found on #gobolinux. And I am not really an anonymouse user, just sometimes too lazy to login ;-)

PS: My IP is never shared, I am just too lazy to login whenever I edit something ;)
(But maybe I reconsider if on the whole Gobolinux infrastructure there would be ONE login to access all resources... wiki, forum, bug tracker etc..)
