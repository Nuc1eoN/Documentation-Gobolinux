# FAQ

The **idea** for this page is to collect and document various FAQs about GoboLinux, that is,
frequently asked questions pertaining to the project at hand - especially when encountering
problems. It is different to the mailing list in that it should be "more general", that is,
not necessarily tied to any individual person at hand (whereas on a mailing list, you usually
have communication from one-to-one user that also eventually becomes forgotten or may have
to be asked again at a later time).

That way if a user runs into a problem, or wants to understand this or that about GoboLinux, then
this can be used as a "jumper" page to jump to the proper documentation - either within the wiki
itself, or as part of a program's --help option or elsewhere.
