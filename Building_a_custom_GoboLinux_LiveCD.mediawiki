* The [[CloopUtils]] package, available at:  http://gobolinux.org/packages/binary/current/CloopUtils--2.00--i686.tar.bz2
** Is this package appropriate for other Linux distibutions?
** I see no particular "home page" for this, although I found:
*** http://packages.debian.org/testing/misc/cloop-utils
*** http://am.xs4all.nl/phpwiki/index.php/CloopUtils

* "A convenience directory. It "mountExtracted" [sic] bind it with /Mount/CD-ROM inside Mounted, i.e., on the chrooted environment, you can access it via /Mount/CD-ROM, using it as a contact to the "external world" to easilly copy files in and out."
** This paragraph doesn't make sense to me.  It needs to be reworded. -- [[Sy]]

I played around a bit too much, and when the CD was unmounted, ejected, reinserted and a <code>mount /Mount/CD-ROM</code> is attempted, it reports
<code>mount: /System/Kernel/Devices/ide/host0/bus1/target0/lun0/cd already mounted or /Mount/CD-ROM busy</code>

Also, sound mysteriously died.  This was solved by rebooting the system. -- [[Sy]]

Is the "No space left on device" message normal?

On the mailing list, Andrï¿½Detsch reported:

Btw, we are moving to squashfs (instead of cloop). I have already updated the
generation scripts, and will update the how-to as soon as a first alpha for
012 becomes released.
