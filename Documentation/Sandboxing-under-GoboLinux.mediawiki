The build system in GoboLinux uses sandboxing to
ensure that all the filesystem writes during the software
install phase are limited to an appropriate part of the
filesystem. GoboLinux 016 ships with two different sandbox
implementations. 

[[UnionSandbox]] is a modern implementation which uses file
system unions to achieve isolation. It is the default
sandbox installer.

FiboSandbox is a fallback method used when a union-filesystem
implementation is not available in the running kernel.
It sets up an isolated environment and commands are
run by a special user (named fibo) without root privileges.

During the installation phase of the software build process, 
most build systems call the <code>install</code>
program to copy files to their destination
directories with the proper ownership and attributes.

Since a change of ownership impossible under FiboSandbox,
GoboLinux substitutes a ```install``` wrapper script for the
<code>install</code> program from the CoreUtils package. 

/System/Index/bin/install points to the <code>install</code>
script from the Scripts package.

Under UnionSandbox, <code>install</code> script translates
the superuser name and forwards the real installation work
to <code>real_install</code>, which is a symlink to the
CoreUtils <code>install</code> utility.

Under FiboSandbox, <code>install</code> ignores
change-of-owner directives.
