The Linux recipe comes with a few patches in order to improve the user's experience with the system. 
The patchset includes, but is not restricted to, the following modifications:

* [[GoboHide]]: allows the legacy tree to be hidden from userspace applications
* [[SquashFS]]: a compressed filesystem which gets uncompressed on demand. This filesystem is currently used on the [[GoboLinux]] ISO, and so it's interesting to have it in order to get the CD contents easily accessible through the ''mount'' command

Eventually, some patches taken from the Linux kernel mailing list are merged into the recipe, especially when they're related to bug fixes on common device drivers.
