The Linux kernel differs from standard packages. It has nothing to be linked against the legacy tree: no libraries, no binaries, no headers, no manuals or info pages. Moreover, there are many things on a regular system which are very tied to the kernel itself, such as the proc and sys filesystems, the device nodes and the boot loader files.

These characteristics lead to the creation of a special directory for the kernel, called /System/Kernel. This tree is organized in the following way:

* /System/Kernel/Boot - Bootloader files, including the kernel image
* /System/Kernel/Devices - Device nodes, populated by Udev + Hotplug
* /System/Kernel/Modules - Kernel modules
* /System/Kernel/Objects - Sysfs, providing information gathered from Linux 2.6
* /System/Kernel/Status - The mounted proc filesystem

The next subsections are going to show you how to keep this directory up to date with newer Linux releases.
