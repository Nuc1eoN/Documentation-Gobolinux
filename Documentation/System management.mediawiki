While maintaining a system, there's a number of routine tasks that you'll probably do every now and then: installing new versions of programs, removing old versions, handling users, and so on.

For most administrative tasks, using GoboLinux is no different than any other distribution. You'll mount devices with <code>mount</code> and handle partitions with the /etc/fstab file (which, translated to the GoboLinux world, lives in /System/Settings); you'll add users with <code>useradd</code> (though be sure to check out the convenience script [[AddUser]]); you'll handle disk space with <code>df</code>, etc.

Managing installed programs, on the other hand, is done in a very GoboLinux-specific way. This chapter will cover the process and tools involved.
