{{ToC}}

Physically, a [[GoboLinux]] boot theme is a single script file located in /Programs/[[BootScripts]]/''<version>''/Themes.

As stated in the previous section, the theme file is loaded by the boot scripts core. Therefore, the theme script is called once for every runlevel change. Although interesting stuff can be done in the script body, a compliant boot script has only to implement the following functions:

* ThemeInit
* ThemeFile
* ThemeBefore
* ThemeAfter
* ThemeFinish

These functions are the hotspots that glue the theme and the boot scripts core together.
