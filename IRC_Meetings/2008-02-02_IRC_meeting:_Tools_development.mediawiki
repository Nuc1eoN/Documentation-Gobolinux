A presumptive agenda for the developer discussion week 5.

* Saturday 2, 11am - US west coast (GMT-8)
* Saturday 2, 5pm - Brazil (GMT-2)
* Saturday 2, 8pm - Central Europe (GMT+1)
* Sunday 3, 8am - New Zealand (GMT+13)

===Development===
* Current development - is the model sufficient
  * svn migration - lead: Lucas
  * leads - feature based
* New tools - Any new tools planned/needed
  * A bridge between InstallPackage and Compile.  Maybe a tool above
    Compile/InstallPackage/Freshen to provide a single interaction point.
    PackageKit support?
  * A tool which suggests a package if an executable isn't found
* Major changes - any major cross-tools changes planned/needed
* Signing tool releases - The signatures are often wrong. Why?  How can we prevent this. (calica)

===Roadmaps===
* coding style - with more people hacking we need a coding style document (for all programming/scripting languages)
  * Keep 3 space indention for shell scripts
  * Use tabs for python
* Use flags - for both Compile and InstallPackage Lead: mhomer
====Scripts====
* unionfs - what to do (fuse?)
  * enable PostInstall to run unsafely if unionfs is unavailable
* /System/Index - when and how (can we implement it in the sandbox as a first stage?)
* cleanup - a lot of duplicated as well as old/deprecated code

====Compile====
* recipes - back to basic "The plan is to make Compile as smart as it can and the recipes as small as possible." - Hisham (2004) (http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/06/05/1949213)
* modularisation - make each build type a module
* ChrootCompile - move functionallity of ChrootCompile into Compile
* librarisation - make Compile the frontend to a Compile library
* python - to ease interaction with tools like Freshen and Manager should Compile be rewritten in python or wrappers added

====BootScripts====
* logging - it's not working
====Manager====
* more modules - expanding it with system configuration
* Freshen - are they doing the same job or are they complements; if latter should Freshen be included in Manager
* AbsTk - make it possible to run manager from the console
====Freshen====
* become single interaction point of all scripts
* share backend with Manager

====Installer====
* partitioning - multiple partitions and mount points from the installer
* net install - download and install packages directly from a repo
====Listener====
