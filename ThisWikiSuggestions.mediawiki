- I want to suggest to find a way to avoid those pesky spammers which boil wikis by putting hyperlinks to ie chinese sites. I know that some wikis have this problem sometimes, i hope there is an easy solution like checking for the hyperlinks and disallowing them if there is a certain pattern or so - [[SheVegen]]
** I did a perminant IP ban of one spammer just now. If I can find a way to add the entire wiki to my watchlist, I'll swat these as they come up. For an automated way of doing it, I would need to take another look at the MediaWiki source code, which is not something I'm particularly looking forward to doing again.

**** Cool! Thanks. I'll try to keep the site spam-free until doing so becomes annoying, at which point I'll become irritated, and find some way to code around the spam. [[User:Dan|Dan]]
