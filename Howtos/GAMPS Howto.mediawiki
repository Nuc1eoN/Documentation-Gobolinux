GAMPS is a GoboLinux/Apache/MySql/P/SSL web serving system.  This document is intended to be a step-by-step manual on setting up a MySQL database server and Apache web server with PHP/Python/Perl/SSL support in GoboLinux.

== MySQL ==
# First, you have to install MySQL. Fire up a console and type

    Once you've answered Compile's initial wave of questions, you should have enough time to make yourself some coffee. 
    # When the compilation has finished, you may choose a config file to use. <br/><br/>The mysql configuration is stored in /Programs/MySQL/Settings/mysql, and the config file actually used has to be named my.cnf. The default config file is my-small.cnf. If you're happy with this, go to the next step; otherwise choose one of the other config files and overwrite my.cnf with it. 
    # Now it's time to start the MySQL server. Do this by typing 
    <pre><nowiki> 
    StartTask MySQL 

#:'''Note:'''<br/>
#:If the server crashes at this moment you might want to check the permissions of /Files/MySQL. Owner and group must both be mysql. You can achieve this by typing 

    and starting the server again. 
    # The next step is to set a password for the mysql root user. Type <blockquote>mysqladmin -u root password mYNewpAsSw0rD</pre> 
    # If you want to start the mysql server automatically at boot time, type  
    <blockquote><nowiki> 
    echo 'Exec "Starting MySQL Database Server..." MySQL Start' \ 
       >> /System/Settings/BootScripts/BootUp 

# You can test your MySQL installation by typing

    mysql -u root -p 

If everything worked, you'll be prompted for a password, then taken to the MySQL monitor.

== OpenSSL - Part 1 ==

     
    == Apache == 
    # As usual, compiling is the first step:<blockquote>Compile HTTPD</pre> 
    # After compilng, Apache should be ready to start. Just type <blockquote>StartTask HTTPD</pre> 
    # If you want to start the Apache server automatically at boot time, type 
    <pre><nowiki> 
    echo 'Exec "Starting Apache Web Server..." HTTPD Start' \ 
       >> /System/Settings/BootScripts/BootUp 


== OpenSSL - Part 2 ==

== PHP ==
# To install Apache PHP Module, type

    <nowiki> 
    Compile Mod_PHP 
    </nowiki> 

# You have to restart Apache to load the new PHP module

    StopTask HTTPD 
    StartTask HTTPD 


== Python ==

# Compile the module

    Compile Mod_Python 


# Restart Apache again

    StopTask HTTPD 
    StartTask HTTPD 


# If you use HTTPD 2.0.x you have to edit your httpd.conf (/Programs/HTTPD/Settings/httpd/httpd.conf) to load the Python module with Apache. Add the following line after the other LoadModule directives:

    LoadModule python_module modules/mod_python.so 
    AddType application/x-python-code pyo pyc 
    AddType text/x-python py
