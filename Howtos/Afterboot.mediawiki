= Introduction =
A list of things to remember after the first boot.  This page is intended to be similar in spirit to the [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=afterboot&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=OpenBSD+Current&arch=i386&format=html  afterboot]  man page of the [http://www.openbsd.org<!--/--> OpenBSD] project.

I (Peter Eriksen) will be updating this page as I'm setting things up. I didn't find anything similar in the documentation, so here goes.  It applies to release 011, and hopefully some of the things are built into the upcomming 012 release.

= [[LiveCD]] Tricks =
If X isn't set up correctly in the installation but works fine on the [[LiveCD]], it might be good to cp the one from the running [[LiveCD]] to the installation.  Here it's done through a floppy:

    ~]mount /Mount/Floppy 
    ~]cp /System/Settings/X11/XF86Config /Mount/Floppy/ 


If networking with DHCP doesn't work on the [[LiveCD]] try this:

    ~]dhcpcd 


= Privilege Escalation =
Add user peter to the system group "sys".  The user could also be added to a group wheel, but I guess, since there is already a group sys with user gobo in it and no group wheel, then it's natural to use sys as the administrator group.

    ~]usermod -G sys peter 

''Below only applies to GoboLinux 013 and earlier as it is default since GoboLinux 014'' <br />
Next give peter root privileges by configuring the sudoers file.

    ~]visudo 

Add e.g. the following line or something similar

    %sys ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL 


= Timezone =

    ~]ls -l /Programs/Glibc/Settings/localtime 
    lrwxrwxrwx  1 gobo gobo 56 2004-12-16 13:42 /Programs/Glibc/Settings/localtime -> /Programs/Glibc/Current/share/zoneinfo/America/Sao_Paulo 
    ~]sudo ln -sf /Programs/Glibc/Current/Shared/zoneinfo/Europe/Copenhagen /Programs/Glibc/Settings/localtime 
    ~]sudo ln -sf /Programs/Glibc/Current/Shared/zoneinfo/Europe/Copenhagen /System/Settings/localtime 

It might be relevant to set the zoneinfo of the system clock.

    ~]ls /usr/share/zoneinfo 

(Suppose you want to use GMT)

    ~]ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/GMT /etc/localtime 


= X.Org =
If the X configuration file from the [[LiveCD]] was saved on a floppy, copy it to the installation.

    ~]mount /Mount/Floppy 
    ~]sudo cp /Mount/Floppy/XF86Config /System/Settings/X11/XF86Config 


=  Boot Menu =

    ~]sudo cp /System/Kernel/Boot/grub/menu.lst /System/Kernel/Boot/grub/menu.lst.backup 
    ~]sudo vi /System/Kernel/Boot/grub/menu.lst 


= Terminal Settings =
If remote ssh programs doesn't work it might be because of the terminal settings.  In that case a workaround could be:

    ~]echo $TERM 
    xterm-color 
    ~]export TERM=xterm 


= Compile Settings =

    ~]sudo vim /Programs/Compile/Settings/Compile/Compile.conf 

Put your name in compile[[RecipeAuthor]]="" and uncomment.
Comment the line "http://cscience.org/~gobo/recipe-store".  Use http://www.gobolinux.org/recipe-store/ instead.

=  Updating the [[GoboLinux]] Infrastructure =
It might be wise to upgrade Compile and other programs
before attempting to compile or install other programs

    ~]InstallPackage Scripts 
    ~]InstallPackage Compile 


= Known Issues =
Remember to look over the [http://www.gobolinux.org/index.php?page=known_issues_014 known issues] for things that might affect you.
Also see if any of the [http://bugs.gobolinux.org tracking bugs] affect you.

= Miscellaneous Files to Check =

    /System/Settings/~BootScripts/Options 
    /System/Settings/hosts 
    /System/Settings/resolv.conf 
    /System/Settings/fstab 
    /System/Settings/modprobe.conf 


= NVIDIA Driver =
In GoboLinux 0.14.1 you will first have to compile a custom kernel without Xen virtualisation as that is unsupported by NVIDIA's proprietary driver. Once that is done, just do:


    ~]Compile nvidia 


Then edit /System/Settings/X11/xorg.conf. You need at least to change 'Driver "nv"' into 'Driver "nvidia"' outcomment "Load dri" if present.

= Workarounds for Recipe Problems =

    ~]cd /Programs/SDL/Current/include 
    ~]ln -s SDL/* . 
    ~]SymlinkProgram SDL
