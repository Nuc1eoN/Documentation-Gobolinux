== ccache ==
You can use ccache to speed up consecutive compilations of the same program.

In general it might be useful to give ccache a try and install it, but don't expect 
it to be too useful either (it's not designed for total world domination - yet ;)).


Here are a few commands to get one started with ccache:

To run ccache together with distcc do:
  CCACHE_PREFIX=distcc

To reset ccache statistics, do:
  ccache -z

To remove all cached files do:
  ccache -C
