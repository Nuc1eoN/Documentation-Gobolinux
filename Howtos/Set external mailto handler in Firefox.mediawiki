If you use Firefox and are not running it in KDE or Gnome you'll often times find that mailto: links don't always or never get handled the way you would like. If you're interested in setting Firefox to handle mailto: links with an external program of any kind, here is how you do it:

# Open Firefox
# In the address bar go to the page "about:config"
# First look for the value of '''network.protocol-handler.expose.mailto''' and set it to ''true''
## If the value doesn't exists right-click and under "New" choose Boolean, then set the name and value to ''true''
# Second look for the value of '''network.protocol-handler.app.mailto''' and set it to the application you want handling your mail.
## As with the previous value, if it doesn't exist: right-click and under "New" choose String, then set it to the value of the application you want handling mail.
## ex. /System/Links/Executables/xmail

==== Notes ====
Some useful ways of using this method is to establish a script to launch a web service as your default means of sending email. A simple script to handle that would be:

''for the gmail service''

    . GoboPath 
    TO=$(echo $1 | sed 's/mailto://') 
    URL="https://mail.google.com/mail?view=cm&tf=0&to=${TO}"
