First of all, my network card is a Broadcom 802.11b/g WLAN pci card built-in in my laptop P4 Compaq Presario 2568.
I didn't found Linux kernel drivers for it, so I used the drivers of my WinXP installation.

What I needed to have it working was basically:

* Install the package WirelessTools
* Get the Win drivers for the wireless device and the .inf file correspondent
* Install the [http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/ ndiswrapper] program
* Use ndiswrapper to install the driver. This is the easy part, just run:
 ndiswrapper -i DRIVER.inf
 ndiswrapper -m
as gobo.
* Use [[WirelessTools]] to configure the interface and to find an wireless network available
* Use ifconfig to open the interface and DHCP to configure the connection.
* Browse the web

You can automate some of this by adding a line to /S/S/modprobe.conf of
install wlan0 modprobe ndiswrapper && iwconfig wlan0 ... (put your usual commands here, with && between)
and then adding wlan0 to /S/S/[[BootOptions]] with the right config.
