Takes a program name and a version and excludes it from the [[GoboLinux]] system. While it's sufficient to manually "rm" the program from the /Programs directory, some broken links will remain on the /System/Links and /System/Settings directories. One can manually "cd" into these dirs and launch "find . | [[RemoveBroken]]", or can use this script to perform this lightweight job. [[RemoveProgram]] avoids scanning the entire /System/Links hierarchy (looking directly at the links from files from the program).

Usage: RemoveProgram <program> <version>

Options:
* '''-h, --help''' - Shows this help.
* '''-v, --version''' - Show program version.
* '''-V, --verbose''' - Enable verbose mode.
* '''-b, --batch''' - Do not ask for confirmation.

Examples:

RemoveProgram Qt 3.2.3
