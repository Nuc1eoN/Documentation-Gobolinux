Given a [[GoboLinux]] binary package, [[InstallPackage]] uncompresses it under /Programs and creates the symlinks at /System/Links and /System/Settings. It's also responsible for checking whether dependencies are available or should be installed/upgraded.

Usage: InstallPackage <package''file>|<package''dir>

Options:
* '''-h, --help''' - Shows this help.
* '''-v, --version''' - Show program version.
* '''-V, --verbose''' - Enable verbose mode.
* '''-b, --batch''' - Do not ask for confirmation.
* '''-D, --no-dependencies''' - Do not try to fullfit dependencies.
* '''-I, --no-install''' - Do not install, only locate and fetch the package. Automatically enables '--keep'
* '''-k, --keep''' - Do not remove downloaded packages.
* '''-c, --verify''' - Verify package checksum and sig.
* '''-s, --same''' ''<entry>'' - What to do when unpackaging over the same version, 'keep', 'remove', 'ask' or 'cancel'. The default value is 'ask'.
* '''-o, --old''' ''<entry>'' - What to do with a previously existing version of a package if found, 'keep', 'remove', 'ask' or 'cancel'. The default value is 'keep'.
* '''-W, --no-web''' - Do not check remote site for packages, and bypass fetching of archives.

Default behavior for --same is 'cancel', for --old is 'keep'. Notice that 'remove' may be dangerous for important system packages as it can leave the system in an inconsistent state during installation.

Examples:

    InstallPackage Gimp--2.0.5.tar.gz
