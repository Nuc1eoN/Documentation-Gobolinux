A wrapper around 'find'. '''FindQuick''' (or 'f' for short) uses a colorized output and has a very reduced syntax.

Usage: '''FindQuick''' <file to search> [<path>]

Options:
* '''-h, --help''' - Shows this help.
* '''-v, --version''' - Show program version.
* '''-V, --verbose''' - Enable verbose mode.

If <file to search> contains "*", it is used directly as an expression for the search. If not, "*" is added to the beginning and the end. If <path> is not specified, the working directory is assumed.

Examples:

    FindQuick "*.c" .. 

Note the added quotes to avoid shell expansion.
