Given a file name, this script verifies if it's a broken link or not. Being a broken one, it gets deleted. 

This script is very useful when used together with <code>find</code> to find stray, broken links.

Example:

    find /System/Index | RemoveBroken 

This is functionally equivalent to
    find /System/Index -xtype l -delete
