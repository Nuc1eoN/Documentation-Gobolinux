=Overview=
Update a recipe to a new version.

==Usage==
   '''NewVersion''' <package> <version> [ <url> ]

===Options===
* '''-h, --help''' - Shows this help.
* '''-v, --version''' - Show program version.
* '''-V, --verbose''' - Enable verbose mode.

===Other considerations===
Optimistically, it assumes only the version number has changed, and the compilation process is still identical. The generated recipe is better understood as a 'template' for the new version recipe.

==Examples==
   NewVersion Allegro 4.1.12

Note that NewVersion attempts to upgrade ''existing'' recipes to a distinctly new version. To create new recipes, use [[MakeRecipe]].  To make changes to an existing version of a recipe (effectively create a new revision), use [[EditRecipe]].
