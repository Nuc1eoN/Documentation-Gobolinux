Fix attributes from files based on its contents. This is useful for restoring the permissions when files are copied from filesystems that do not support Unix-style permission (like FAT floppies).

Usage: '''FixAttributes''' [options...] files...

Options:
* '''-h, --help''' - Shows this help.
* '''-v, --version''' - Show program version.
* '''-V, --verbose''' - Enable verbose mode.
* '''-R, --recursive''' - Recurses into subdirectories fixing permissions.
* '''-t, --true''' ''<entry>'' - Sets permission <entry> if file is considered executable.
* '''-f, --false''' ''<entry>'' - Sets permission <entry> if file is considered not executable.

Example:
 FixAttributes -t 700 -f 600 *

== Configuration ==
Default permission modes are obtained from <code>FixAttributes.conf</code>.

Typical contents are
<blockquote>
fixatChmodTrue=755 <br/>
fixatChmodFalse=644 <br/>
</blockquote>
which will change files which seem to be executables to mode 755 (owner read, write, execute; group read, execute; others read, execute),
and files which do not seem to be executables to mode 644 (owner read, write; group read; others read.)
