=== Introduction ===

With '''Compile''',  GoboLinux build utility, software
sources can be downloaded, compiled and installed in a
single step. To install '''irssi''', a text-based IRC client
from the command line, you'd type

    Compile irssi 

Depending on the speed of your computer, internet connection
and what packages you have installed, Irssi should download
and install in a few minutes.

Compile manages the build process using GoboLinux recipes.
Each recipe contains a list of build directives and
supplemental control files for compiling a particular
software library. 

=== Finding recipes ===

Typically, you can just try the name of the recipe you want from the command line. There is also an [http://recipes.gobolinux.org online recipe viewer].

=== Command-line options ===

Compile has a number of command-line options, which are
[[Compile|listed here]]. The following are especially
useful.

When using the <code>--batch</code> or <code>-b</code>
automatically attempts to process all dependencies of the
requested program.

=== Separating download and compile phases ===

The next two options are useful when working with
intermittent internet access, or if you'd like to run your
compiling jobs at night when you're asleep.

Calling Compile with the <code>--no-build</code> flag downloads
sources only.  Later, you use the <code>--no-web</code> flag, directing
Compile to search to your system's own download cache and
build the sources found there.

=== Getting the latest Compile ===

* To use the development version of Compile, run 
   Compile Compile git

* To use the latest stable version, run 
   InstallPackage Compile

In general it is recommended to always use the latest stable
version of [[Compile]]. [[Compile]] is very important to
GoboLinux so if there is any problem in it, it is normally
fixed very quickly.
