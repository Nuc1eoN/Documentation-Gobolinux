Note: this template doesn't expand to anything when it's called, and the parameter isn't used. This is by design.

-->This is the Question template.  Include it on a page when you have questions about the content, or think it is ambiguous.  For example, say you are reading an article about the file system organization, and you are confused.  You could add:

<nowiki>{{Question | What is the purpose of /Depot? }}</nowiki>

to the text.  This would bring it to the attention of wiki maintainers, who will add text to the article to answer the question.

You should put the question in the relevant part of the page you are editing, but it will not show up when viewing the article.  (That would look pretty silly!)  Instead, your question will show up at [[Project:Questions]], where editors will see it.
