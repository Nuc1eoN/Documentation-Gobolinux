This script is used everywhere inside many scripts. It exports shell variables such as <code>$goboExecutables</code>, <code>$goboUsers</code>, <code>$goboKernel</code>, and so on, which contains a string specifying where in the file system these entries are (<code>/System/Index/bin</code>, <code>/Users</code>, <code>/System/Kernel</code>, and so on).

For example, in the <code>Scripts</code> package, within the <code>bin/</code> subdirectory are files such as <code>ScriptFunctions</code> or <code>SuggestUpdates</code>, among others. These source <code>GoboPath</code> via:

    . GoboPath

This is normally within the <code>Scripts</code> package, at <code>bin/GoboPath</code>. The whole GoboLinux hierarchy is kept as referential prefix in that file. The variable <code>$goboPrefix</code> keeps track as to where GoboLinux is mounted at.

Let's avoid hardcoding things, sourcing this file and using these variables makes the world a better place :-)
