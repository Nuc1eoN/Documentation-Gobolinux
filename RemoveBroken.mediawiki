Given a file name, this script verifies if it's a broken link or not. Being a broken one, it gets deleted. 

This script is very useful when used together with "find" to find stray, broken links, as in 
"find /System/Links | [[RemoveBroken]]".

Example:
<pre>
  find /System/Links | RemoveBroken
</pre>

This is functionally equivalent to
 find /System/Links -xtype l -delete
