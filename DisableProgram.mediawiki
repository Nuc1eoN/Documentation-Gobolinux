Sometimes it's desirable to keep a program installed on its directory, but not reacheable through the /System/Links tree. [[DisableProgram]] can be used to remove all the symlinks related to a given program, while still maintaining it on the file system.

Usage: '''DisableProgram''' <program> [<version>]

Options:
* '''-h, --help''' - Shows this help.
* '''-v, --version''' - Show program version.
* '''-V, --verbose''' - Enable verbose mode.

This script "disables" a program in the system, while keeping it in the /Programs hierarchy. To "re-enable" it, run [[SymlinkProgram]]. If version is not specified, Current is assumed.

Examples:
<pre>
DisableProgram GCC 2.95.3
</pre>
