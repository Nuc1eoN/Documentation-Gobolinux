==Introduction==
Chroot enviroments are useful when developing recipes as the recipe is compiled in a separate environment. This means that should the compile fail then you won't be left with a half installed application.

This howto will demonstrate how to setup a chroot environment for use with the ChrootCompile scripts.


==Preparation==

These commands should generally be executed in your own home directory.

If you haven't done so install ChrootCompile

<blockquote>
InstallPackage ChrootCompile
</blockquote>

or if you want the latest development version

<blockquote>
Compile ChrootCompile svn
</blockquote>

The development version of ChrootCompile might need the development version of Compile:

<blockquote>
Compile Compile svn
</blockquote>

==Setup==

Setup the base environment:

<blockquote>
cd ~
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
mkdir My_Compile_Chroot
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
ChrootCompile -s ~/My_Compile_Chroot
</blockquote>


You can now use :

<blockquote>
ChrootCompile <recipe_name> <recipe_version>
</blockquote>

to compile recipes. The recipe will be compiled and if the compile is successful a package will be placed in My_Compile_Chroot/Clean. You can install this package to install the recipe on your system.
