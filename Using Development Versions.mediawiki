To use development versions of the GoboLinux tools, install them via Compile, passing "svn" as a version number. This will fetch the latest version from Subversion.

 Compile Scripts svn
 Compile Compile svn

This will leave a checked-out copy of the tool in your /Files/Compile/Sources directory. When you re-run Compile later, it will reuse this copy and only download what's changed.

You can also run straight from a checked-out repository. For example:

 cd /Programs/Scripts
 svn co http://svn.gobolinux.org/tools/trunk/Scripts 2.9-SVN
 SymlinkProgram Scripts 2.9-SVN
 UpdateSettings Scripts

 cd /Programs/Compile
 svn co http://svn.gobolinux.org/tools/trunk/Compile 1.11-SVN
 SymlinkProgram Compile 1.11-SVN
 UpdateSettings Compile

Compile handles version numbers containing the string "SVN" specially (it disables version checking for compatibility between Scripts and Compile).
