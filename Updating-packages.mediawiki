== Overview ==
Use the [[UpdateRecipes]] command to refresh your local cache of the GoboLinux recipe store.

You can query available updates using the utilities [[SuggestUpdates]], [[SuggestDuplicates]] and [[PrioritiseUpdates]]. The output of each of these commands is suitable for piping into commands.

The [[FindPackage]] and [[GetAvailable]] commands may also be useful.

=== Example Update Process ===

Keep in mind that most operations that change the file-system state in Gobo require super user privileges:

==== Ensure that Scripts are up to date ====

 cd /Programs/Scripts/Current
 sudo git pull && sudo UpdateSettings --auto Scripts && sudo make

==== Ensure that Compile is up to date ====

 cd /Programs/Compile/Current
 sudo git pull && sudo UpdateSettings --auto Compile

==== UpdateRecipes - Update local copy of recipe store ====

 cd /Data/Compile/Recipes
 sudo UpdateRecipes

==== SuggestUpdates - List packages with an update available ====
 SuggestUpdates

==== PrioritiseUpdates - Order output of SuggestUpdates by dependency ====
