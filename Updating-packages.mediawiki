Use the [[UpdateRecipes]] command to refresh your local cache of the GoboLinux recipe store.

[[Freshen]] is a console application that checks for updated GoboLinux recipes and packages, with an output similar to "emerge" in Gentoo.

You can query available updates using the utilities [[SuggestUpdates]], [[SuggestDuplicates]] and [[PrioritiseUpdates]]. Outputs are suitable for piping into commands.

The [[FindPackage]] and [[GetAvailable]] commands may also be useful.
