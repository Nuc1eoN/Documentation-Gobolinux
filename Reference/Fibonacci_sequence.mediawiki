Fibonacci sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ... generated by the rule f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)

It was introduced by [[Fibonacci of Pisa]] in [[Liber abaci]] in a problem involving the growth of a population of rabbits.
