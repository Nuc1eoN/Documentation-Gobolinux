Compile.conf is the file where you can configure the various paths and URLs used by [[Compile]].

It is stored at /Programs/Compile/Settings/Compile/Compile.conf -- which, once installed, has a link at /System/Settings/Compile/Compile.conf (if you're used to the GoboLinux tree, you should know by now that this is the same as /etc/Compile/Compile.conf).

These are the usual contents of the file:

Your name here so that credit is added to recipes.

    compileRecipeAuthor="Paul McCartney" 
    # example only! change the name (unless of course, you're Paul ;) ) 


The standard locations for your local Compile files.

    compileDir="${goboPrefix}/Files/Compile"
    compileArchivesDir="$compileDir/Archives"
    compileSourcesDir="$compileDir/Sources"
    compileRecipeDirs="$compileDir/Recipes"


Some of the main free software repositories are treated especially: recipes use these variables in their <code>url</code> declarations, so that you can pick your favorite mirror without having to edit recipes one by one:

    ftpGnu=ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ 
    ftpAlphaGnu=ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/ 
    httpSourceforge=http://unc.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/ 


The Compile recipe tree is managed by Git. The git repository and the upstream branch are both configurable through the following variables:

    compileRecipesRepository=https://github.com/gobolinux/Recipes.git
    compileUpstreamBranch=master


A variable to set the "make" command called by Compile. ColorMake provides the highlighting that GoboLinux has by default:

    compileMakeCommand="ColorMake" 


Options to use with the make command. This can be used to run multiple threads in parallel on different CPUs or for other customisation:

    compileMakeOptions="-j2"
