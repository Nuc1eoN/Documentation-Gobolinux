Tasks are contained within some special packages, and the available tasks can be found at /System/Links/Tasks.

In order to start a task, one has to call "[[StartTask]] ''TaskName''". Tasks are written so that they are automatically put into background, making it unnecessary to explicitly include the control operator "&" after this command.
