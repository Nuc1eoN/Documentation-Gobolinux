'''Manager''' is a graphical package management front-end for [[GoboLinux]].

It enables the user to keep track of all installed versions of programs as well as what new versions are available to be installed.

A more complete description can be found on the GoboLinux website, [http://gobolinux.org/index.php?lang=en_US&page=manager here].

Manager is shipped by default in [[GoboLinux 014]], but it also works on previous releases, provided you have a recent [[Scripts]] package, as well as in the [[Rootless]] hosted mode. Both can be found at the [http://gobolinux.org/index.php?page=packages packages page].
