C2 Wiki was the birthplace for a "wiki pattern" called "Therefore, But."  We can extend that pattern.  This is a typical example:

----

There is a need for a consistent template for use in the GoboLinux wiki/knowledge base.

'''Therefore...'''

We should investigate Therefore/But pattern as it came to be on the C2 wiki.

'''But...'''

It might not always be the most suitable for all kinds of presentation.

'''However...'''

Constraining all templates to a single format ''of any kind,'' regardless of what that format is, will have the same problems anyway.

'''What about...''' ''(allows '''limited''' thread-mode discussion.  Should be refactored if it gets extensive.)''

Discussions?  ''Discussions can be held on a simple FooDiscussions page instead. --SomeBody''

----

Obviously, more serious content will have entire (sets of) paragraphs instead of single sentences.

{{Discussions}}
