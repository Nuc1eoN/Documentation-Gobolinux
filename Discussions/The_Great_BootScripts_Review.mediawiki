[[GoboLinux]] 011 will feature new [[BootScripts]]. The thing is, we still don't know what they will look like.

A few guidelines, though:

* some level of init independence, so that people can switch to whatever init model they prefer without much fuss.
* some level of /etc/[[init.d]] compatibility.
* we don't want to lose features (the original simplicity, themeability...)

More ideas?

* The ability to run things in parallel to decrease boottimes.
* [[Need]] based dependencies
* [[RunLevels]] to set running state and ease dependency tracking.
* Fast shutdown by adding "halt" to the arguments for init scripts - most programs don't need to be shutdown cleanly.
* Add here!

Alternative bootscripts systems under consideration:

* [[Calica]]'s Python [[BootScripts]] Experiment
* minit - a small yet feature-complete init -- http://www.fefe.de/minit/
* Know another? Add here!
