This area is to document our needs and solutions with regards to Need based dependencies.  To understand the reasons see the discussion below.

* As we reach consensus on requirements and solutions they will be listed here.

* In a nutshell, init scripts can specify another init script to run before it.

* For a more detailed description and implementation by Richard Gooch, see  http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rgooch/linux/boot-scripts/ .

----
My Python [[BootScripts]] (any name suggestions?) supports this along with runlevels.  Each runlevel script may "need" a taskdir, which will start each init file in that directory.

I would like some input on proper failure handling.  Here are a few possibilities.
* need exits and the script checks the return code.
** I think this is the simplest/best option. It could be pretty clean (Need foo || Die, Need foo || [[PassAway]]). -- [[hisham]]
* init master kills the calling init script.  Runlevel scripts should continue???  Pro: very clean runlevel/init scripts.  Con: no graceful failure
* timeout value.  If "need" doesn't timeout your boot process could stall forever.  What is a good default value.  Is this a fatal failure?
