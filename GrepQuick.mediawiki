This is a wrapper around 'grep'. [[GrepQuick]] (of 'g' for short) uses a colorized output and has a very reduced syntax.

Usage: '''GrepQuick''' <pattern> [<files...>]

Options:
* '''-h, --help''' - Shows this help.
* '''-v, --version''' - Show program version.
* '''-V, --verbose''' - Enable verbose mode.
* '''-r, --recursive''' - Recursive.
* '''-s, --source''' - Special mode for C/C++/Java sources. Skips comments if the [[FilterComments]] script is available.
* '''-w, --whole-word''' - Match whole words only.
* '''-C, --no-color''' - Avoid coloring (for grep's that don't support it).

Search is case sensitive only if there is at least one uppercase character in the pattern. Binary files are not searched. Error messages are not displayed. Line numbers are displayed. If no files are specified, all files are selected (except in "source" mode, where <nowiki>*.[CcHh]*</nowiki> is selected instead).

Example:
<blockquote>
g foo <br/>
</blockquote>
