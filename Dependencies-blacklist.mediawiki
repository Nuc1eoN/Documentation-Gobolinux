== Configuring Dependencies ==
Today there are many programs implementing a given feature in different ways. One such example is the OpenGL API, with implementations floating in packages such as Xorg, MesaLib and Nvidia. However, not every user owns a Nvidia card, and here comes a problem: how should one mask Nvidia from the automated Dependencies list generated after creating a recipe? This problem is now fixed with a configurable file called <tt>/Programs/Scripts/Settings/Scripts/Dependencies.blacklist</tt>.

=== Dependencies.blacklist ===
This file allows one to specify packages that should not appear in the Dependencies file after creating a new recipe. Its format is pretty simple: one package per line, without the need to specify its version.

==== An Dependencies.blacklist example ====
The following example blacklists the packages Glibc and Nvidia. Comments and blank lines are ignored by the parser, so it's ok to include them.

    # Dependencies.blacklist is documented in detail at 
    #  http://wiki.gobolinux.org/Dependencies 
     
    Glibc 
    Nvidia 


Note: presently blacklisting specific versions is not supported, but the same behaviour can be achieved by creating an empty directory in the <tt>/Programs</tt> directory.  For example, to blacklist GCC version 4.1.2 you may:

    mkdir /Programs/GCC/4.1.2
