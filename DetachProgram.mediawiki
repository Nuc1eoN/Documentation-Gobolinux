Given a program name and a target directory, moves this program from its entry in /Programs to the specified target dir, being substituted by a symlink to this target dir. This feature is interesting when one would like to move a package to another partition, for example, but still wants the package to be visible at /Programs. All the symlinks are re-generated to point to the target directory.

Usage: '''DetachProgram''' <program> [<version>] [<destdir>]

Options:
* '''-h, --help''' - Shows this help.
* '''-v, --version''' - Show program version.
* '''-V, --verbose''' - Enable verbose mode.
* '''-c, --copy''' - Copy program.  Keep existing on rootfs.
* '''-b, --batch''' - Batch operation.  Minimize warning output
* '''-D, --no-dependencies''' - Do not try to fulfill dependencies.

This script 'moves' a program from the /Programs hierarchy to <destdir> directory.  Afterwards, symlinks are created in /Programs to maintain functionality.  If <destdir> is omitted the environment variable $goboInstall is used.

Examples:
<pre>
DetachProgram GCC 2.95.3 /Network/Programs
</pre>
