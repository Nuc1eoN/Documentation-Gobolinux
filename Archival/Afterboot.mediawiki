=  Boot Menu =

    ~]sudo cp /System/Kernel/Boot/grub/menu.lst /System/Kernel/Boot/grub/menu.lst.backup 
    ~]sudo vi /System/Kernel/Boot/grub/menu.lst 


= Terminal Settings =
If remote ssh programs doesn't work it might be because of the terminal settings.  In that case a workaround could be:

    ~]echo $TERM 
    xterm-color 
    ~]export TERM=xterm 


=  Updating the GoboLinux Infrastructure =

It might be wise to upgrade Compile and other programs
before attempting to compile or install other programs

    ~]InstallPackage Scripts 
    ~]InstallPackage Compile 

= Miscellaneous Files to Check =

    /System/Settings/~BootScripts/Options 
    /System/Settings/hosts 
    /System/Settings/resolv.conf 
    /System/Settings/fstab 
    /System/Settings/modprobe.conf 


= NVIDIA Driver =
In GoboLinux 0.14.1 you will first have to compile a custom kernel without Xen virtualisation as that is unsupported by NVIDIA's proprietary driver. Once that is done, just do:

    ~]Compile nvidia 


Then edit /System/Settings/X11/xorg.conf. You need at least to change 'Driver "nv"' into 'Driver "nvidia"' outcomment "Load dri" if present.

= Workarounds for Recipe Problems =

    ~]cd /Programs/SDL/Current/include 
    ~]ln -s SDL/* . 
    ~]SymlinkProgram SDL
